# SNotify
SNotify gives your Spotify Windows Client two additional abilities: global hotkeys and toast notifications.

You can easily customize how toast notification looks by tweaking various options like fonts, colors etc. and define hotkeys for play/pause, previous/next track and volume controls.

## Installation and Usage
You have two options to download and use SNotify:

1. Visit [releases](https://github.com/adnantopal/snotify/releases) page to download latest compiled version of SNotify. Unzip release package to a location where you want the application to reside and run `SNotify.exe`.
2. If you have AutoHotkey installed in your PC, you can download master repository, unzip the package where you want the scripts to reside and run `snotify.ahk` without the need to compile AutoHotkey code.

It's recommended to use compiled versions that's described in 1st option because they're the stable releases of SNotify.
